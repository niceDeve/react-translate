`React-Philosophies` is:
- things I think about before I write my code in React.
- at the back of my mind whenever I review someone else's code or my own
- just as guidelines and not rigid rules.
- living document and will evolve overtime as I my experiences grows.

Inspired by various places I've stumbled upon at different points of my coding journey, 
most notably:

- [Tim Peters: Zen of Python (Pep 20)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
- [Dev Cheney: Zen of Go](https://dave.cheney.net/2020/02/23/the-zen-of-go)

- [droogans/unmaintainable-code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code)

If there's something that you think should be part of my reading list, or you have great ideas that you think I should include here,  
don't hesitate to submit a PR or an issue; I'll check it out.

A lot of these things may feel like very basic and common sense but I've 
worked with many large complex applications that seem to... well, not care.
