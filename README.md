Note: 
As I was writing this, I realized that it was actually difficult for me to separate my thoughts into the `design`, `performance`, and `testing`. I noticed that a lot of designs aimed for maintainability also makes your application faster. How cool is that?

# üí™ 0. Introduction 
`react-philosophies` is:
- things I think about before I write `React` code.
- at the back of my mind whenever I review someone else's code or my own
- just guidelines and NOT rigid rules
- a living document and will evolve overtime as I my experience grows
- mostly techniques are seems like variations of basic refactoring methods, SOLID principles, and extreme programming ideas, just applied to React specifically.

A lot of these things may feel like very basic and common sense but I've worked with many large complex applications that seem to... well... not care.

`react-philosophies` is inspired by various places I've stumbled upon at different points of my coding journey.

# üí™ 1. The Bare Minimum

## This might sound crazy but a lot of times, the computer is smarter than you
1. Use ESLint including `rule-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps`
2. Do NOT ignore exhaustive-deps warnings / errors for `useMemo`, `useCallback` and `useEffect`
3. Remember to add keys whenever you use `map` to display components
4. Remember to NOT use hooks inside conditionals, always put them at the top
5. Do NOT ignore the warning ["Can't perform state update on unmounted component."](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56442582/react-hooks-cant-perform-a-react-state-update-on-an-unmounted-component)
6. If you see a warning or error in the console, Do not ignore it.
7. Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format your code
8. Use [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/quality/) (or similar) to detect code smells

### TLDR
1. Think first before adding another dependency (loadash, fetching libraries, redux)
2. Use `map`, `filter` if you can, avoid traditional loops if you can
3. üíñ Simplify complex conditionals, and exit early if you can
5. You're probably NOT gonna need it. 
6. Avoid premature generalization
7. If your solution of an simple feature requires an expensive setup, consider other options

### TLDR
1. üíñ Derive states to avoid state management complexity 
2. üíñ Pass the banana, not the gorilla and the entire jungle, (prefer passing primitives as props)
3. üíñ Separate concerns with the single responsibility principle
4. üíñ Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction
5. Avoid prop drilling by using composition
6. Breakdown large `useEffect`s to smaller ones
7. Extract logic to hooks and helper functions
8. Prefer having mostly primitives as dependencies to `useCallback`, `useMemo` and `useEffect`
9. Consider using `useReducer`, when some elements of your state relies on other values of your state
10. Do not put too many dependencies in `useCallback`, `useMemo` and `useEffect`
11. `Context` is not the solution for every state sharing problem
12. It maybe an good idea to have `logical` and `presentational` components, if your component gets too large
13. Practice state colocation

## 2.1 Derive states to avoid state management complexity
When you have redundant states, some states may fall out of sync if we forget to update it given a complex sequence of interactions.
Aside from avoiding `synchronization bugs`, you'd notice that it's also easier to reason about and require less code. (Remember: Code is Evil!)

### Example 1
Suppose you fetch a list of two numbers `{a: number, b: number}[]`. The two numbers represent the two shorter sides 
of a right triangle. The length of the three sides, the perimeter, and the area of each triangle should be displayed

  const [perimeters, setPerimeters] = useState<number[]>([])
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState<number[]>([])

      setArea(triangleInfo.map(t => computeArea(t.a, t.b))  
  }, [triangleInfo])

  useEffect(() => {
    const p = triangleInfo((t, i) => {
      return computePerimeter(t.a, t.b, hypotenuse[i])

## 2.2 If you need a banana, pass the banana, not the gorilla and the entire jungle 
>  You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. - Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang, on software reusability.

One thing that can help you with this is to pass primitives (`boolean`, `string`, `number` etc), instead of passing objects.
Also, passing primitives is also a good idea because you may want to use `React.memo` in the future if you need to for optimization.

### Example
A `UserCard` component that displays a `Summary`, and `SeeMore` components. Add a button to toggle between showing and hiding the age and bio on of the user.

The `Summary` component that displays the display name (e.g. `Mr Vincenzo Cassano`) and a picture. Clicking the name display takes you to the user's personal site.
(The `Summary` component may have other functionalities like changing the font, size of the image, and background color randomly upon clicking)

The `UserCard` calls the hook `useUser` that return's an object with the type below.
        
```ts
type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  title: string
  imgUrl: string
  webUrl: string
  age: number
  bio: string
  /****** 20 or more fields containing more information about the user ******/
}
```
<details>
  <summary>‚ùå Bad solution</summary>
  
```tsx

const Summary = ({user}: {user: User}) => {
  /*** includes functionality for switching image size, font, and background color randomly  upon clicking ***/
  return (
    <>
      <img src={user.imgUrl} />
       <a href={user.webUrl}>{user.title}. {user.firstName} {user.lastName}</a>
    </>
  )
}

const SeeMore = ({user}: {user: User}) => {
  const [seeMore, setSeeMore] = useState<boolean>(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => { setSeeMore(!seeMore)} }>See more</button>
      {seeMore && <>AGE: {user.age} | BIO: {user.bio}</>}
    </>
  )
}


const UserCard = () => {
  const user = useUser()
  return <><Summary user={user} /><SeeMore user={user} /></>
}
 
```
        
</details>
        

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Better solution</summary>
  
```tsx

const Summary = ({ imgUrl, webUrl, displayName } : {imgUrl: string, webUrl: string, displayName: string}) => {
   /*** includes functionality for switching image size, font, and background color randomly  upon clicking ***/
  return (
    <>
      <img src={imgUrl} />
       <a href={webUrl}>{displayName}</a>
    </>
  )
}

const SeeMore = ({ age, bio } : {age: number, bio: string}) => {
  const [seeMore, setSeeMore] = useState<boolean>(false)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => { setSeeMore(!seeMore)} }>See more</button>
      {seeMore && <>AGE: {age} | BIO: {bio}</>}
    </>
  )
}


const UserCard = () => {
  const { title, firstName, lastName, webUrl, imgUrl, age, bio} = useUser()
  return (
    <>
      <Summary displayName={`${title}. ${firstName} ${lastName}`} {...{imgUrl, webUrl}}/>
      <SeeMore {...{age, bio}} />

# üí™ 3. Performance tips
       
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

### TLDR
1. If you think it‚Äôs slow, prove it with a benchmark.  ‚ÄúIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.‚Äù
3. Split code to bundles
4. `useMemo` mostly just for expensive calculations
5. `React.memo` for reducing re-renders
6.  Make sure your `React.memo`, `useCallback` and `useMemo` is doing what you think it's doing (preventing rerendering)
7. Window large lists (with React virtual or similar)
8. Put `Context` as low as possible in your component tree. `Context` does not have to be global to your whole app.
9. `Context` should be logically separated
10. You can optimize `context` by separating the `state` and the `dispatch` function
11. Stop punching yourself everytime you blink (fixing slow rerenders before fixing rerenders)
       
# 4. Testing principles

### TLDR
>  Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. - Guillermo Rauch‚Äè (creator of Socket.io)

1. Your tests should always resemble the way your software is used
2. Stop testing implementation details
3. If your tests don't make you confident that you didn't break anything, then they didn't do their (one and only) job 
4. For the front-end, You don't need 100% code coverage, about 70% is okay
5. You should very rarely have to change tests when you refactor code.
       
# üí™ 5. Spotting a low-hanging Fruit
Ask yourself do you really need it as a dependency?
```tsx
‚ùå BAD
const decrement = useCallback(() => setCount(count - 1), [count]) 

‚úÖ BETTER
const decrement = useCallback(() => setCount(count => count - 1), [])
        
‚ùå BAD
const MyComponent = () => {
  const componentNeedsToCallThisFunction = useCallback(x: string => `Hello ${x}! I am actually doing more than this`,[])
  const iAmAConstant = useMemo(() => { return {x: 5, y: 2} }, [])
  /* I will use componentNeedsToCallThisFunction and iAmAConstant here */
}
        
‚úÖ BETTER 
 const I_AM_A_CONSTANT =  { x: 5, y: 2 }
 const componentNeedsToCallThisFunction = (x: string => `Hello ${x}! I am actually doing more than this`)
 const MyComponent = () => {
      /* I will use componentNeedsToCallThisFunctions and I_AM_A_CONSTANT */
  }

```
