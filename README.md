Note: 
As I was writing this, I realized that it was actually difficult for me to separate my thoughts into the `design`, `performance`, and `testing`. I noticed that a lot of designs aimed for maintainability also makes your application faster. How cool is that?

I noticed that most of the techniques are variations of basic refactoring methods, SOLID principles, and programming ideas, just applied to React specifically.

# Introduction 
`react-philosophies` is:
- things I think about before I write `React` code.
- at the back of my mind whenever I review someone else's code or my own
- just guidelines and NOT rigid rules
- a living document and will evolve overtime as I my experience grows

A lot of these things may feel like very basic and common sense but I've worked with many large complex applications that seem to... well, not care.

`react-philosophies` is inspired by various places I've stumbled upon at different points of my coding journey.

# The Bare Minimum

## This might sound crazy but a lot of times, the computer is smarter than you
1. Use ESLint including `rule-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps`
2. Do NOT ignore exhaustive-deps warnings / errors for `useMemo`, `useCallback` and `useEffect`
3. Remember to add keys whenever you use `map` to display components
4. Do NOT ignore the warning ["Can't perform state update on unmounted component."](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56442582/react-hooks-cant-perform-a-react-state-update-on-an-unmounted-component)
5. If you see a warning or error in the console, Do not ignore it.
6. Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format your code
7. Use [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/quality/) (or similar) to detect code smells

## Code is just a necessary evil

> The best code is no code at all Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported." - Jeff Atwood

**TLDR:**
1. Think first before adding another dependency (loadash, fetching libraries, redux)
2. Use `map`, `filter` if you can
3. Simplify complex conditionals
5. üíñ  You're probably NOT gonna need it. 
6. Avoid premature generalization
7. Think about the expensive setup

# Design for happiness
> ‚ÄúAny fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.‚Äù - Martin Fowler
> ‚ÄúIndeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read‚Äù ‚Äï Robert C. Martin

**TLDR:**
1. Derive states to avoid state management complexity
2. Pass the banana, not the gorilla and the entire jungle
3. Separate concerns with the single responsibility principle
4. `logical` and `presentational` components
5. Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction
6. Avoid prop drilling by using composition
7. Prefer passing primitives as props
8. Breakdown `useEffect`s
9. Extract logic to hooks and helper functions
10. Prefer having mostly primitives as dependencies to `useCallback`, `useMemo` and `useEffect`
11. Do not put too many dependencies in `useCallback`, `useMemo` and `useEffect`
12. `Context` is not the solution for every state sharing problem


## Deriving states to avoid state management complexity
  
#### Example 1
Suppose you fetch a list of two numbers `{a: number, b: number}[]`. The two numbers represent the two shorter sides 
of a right triangle. The length of the three sides, the perimeter, and the area of each triangle should be displayed

<details>
  <summary> ‚ùå Bad Solution </summary>

```tsx    
const TriangleInfo = () => {
  const [triangleInfo, setTriangleInfo] = useTriangles<{a: number, b: number}>([])
  const [hypotenuses, setHypotenuses] = useState<number[]>([])
  const [perimeters, setPerimeters] = useState<number[]>([])
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState<number[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTriangles().then(r => { 
      setTriangleInfo(r)
      setHypotenuses(r.map(t => computeHypotenuse(t.a, t.b))  
      setArea(r.map(t => computeArea(t.a, t.b))  
    })
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
      setHypotenuses(triangleInfo.map(t => computeHypotenuse(t.a, t.b))  
      setArea(triangleInfo.map(t => computeArea(t.a, t.b))  
  }, [triangleInfo])

  useEffect(() => {
    const p = triangleInfo((t, i) => {
      return computePerimeter(t.a, t.b, hypotenuse[i])
    })
  }, [triangleInfo, hypotenuses])

  /*** show here info here ****/
}
```

</details> 

<details>
  <summary> ‚úÖ Better Solution </summary>

 ```tsx
 const TriangleInfo = () => {
   const [triangleInfo, setTriangleInfo] = useTriangles<{a: number, b: number}>([])
 
   useEffect(() => {
     fetchTriangles().then(r => setTriangleInfo(r))
   }, [])
   
   const areas = triangleInfo.map(t => computeArea(t.a, t.b))
   const hypotenuses = triangleInfo.map(t => computeHypotenuse(t.a, t.b))
   const perimeters = triangleInfo.map((t, i) => computePerimeters(t.a, t.b, hypotenuses[i]))
   
   /*** show here info here ****/
 }
 ```  
</details> 


#### Example 2
Suppose you are assigned to make a component which fetches a list of unique points
There is a button to either sort by x or y and a button
to filter points that farther than a specific distance from the origin `(0, 0)` 

<details>
  <summary> ‚ùå Bad Solution </summary>
  
```tsx
type SortBy = 'x' | 'y'
const toggle = (current: SortBy): SortBy => current === 'x' ? : 'y' : 'x' 
const Points = () => {
  const [points, setPoints] = useState<{x: number, y: number}[]>([])
  const [filteredPoints, setFilteredPoints] = useState<{x: number, y: number}[]>([])
  const [sortedPoints, setSortedPoints] = useState<{x: number, y: number}[]>([])
  const [maxDistance, setMaxDistance] = useState<number>(Infinity)
  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<SortBy>('x')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPoints().then(r => setPoints(r))
  }, [])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setSortedPoints(sortPoints(points, sortBy))
  }, [sortBy, points])

  useEffect(() => {
    setFilteredPoints(sortedPoints.filter(p => getDistance(p.x, p.y) < maxDistance))
  }, [sortedPoints, maxDistance])

  const otherSortBy = toggle(sortBy)
  
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => { setSortBy(otherSortBy)}}>Sort by: {otherSortBy} <button>
      <button onClick={() => { setMaxDistance(maxDistance + 5)}}>Add 5 to max distance<button>
      Showing only points that are less than {maxDistance} units away from origin `(0, 0)`
      <ol>{filteredPoints.map(p => <li key={`${p.x}|{p.y}`}>({p.x}, {p.y})</li>}
    </>

  )
}
```

type SortBy = 'x' | 'y'
const toggle = (current: SortBy): SortBy => current === 'x' ? : 'y' : 'x'

## Prefer fewer dependencies

```tsx
‚ùå ‚ùå bad ‚ùå ‚ùå
const decrement = useCallback(() => setCount(count - 1), [count]) 

‚úÖ ‚úÖ Better ‚úÖ ‚úÖ 
const decrement = useCallback(() => setCount(count => count - 1), [])

```

# Performance tips
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

**TLDR:**
1. Measure first with the React profiler
3. Splitting code to bundles
4. `useMemo` for expensive calculations
5. `React.memo` for reducing re-renders
6.  Make sure your `useCallback` and `useMemo` is doing what you think it's doing (preventing rerendering)
7. Window large lists (with React virtual or similar)
8. Put `Context` as low as possible in your component tree. `Context` does not have to be global to your whole app.
9. `Context` should be logically separated
10. You can optimize `context` by separating the `state` and `dispatch` function
11. Stop punching yourself everytime you blink (fixing slow rerenders before fixing rerenders)

# Testing principles

**TLDR:**
1. Your tests should resemble the way your software is used
2. Stop testing implementation details
3. If your tests don't make you confident that you didn't break anything, then it didn't do its (on and only) job 
4. You don't need 100% code coverage, about 70% is okay
